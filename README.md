* NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) summer project with Dr. Jens Kauffmann at MIT Haystack Observatory
* Wrote Python programs to theoretically observe unresolved molecular clouds in extragalactic systems
* This was first done with numerical optimization using SciPy Optimize Minimize, then with probabilistic programming using PyMC3

**Documents**
* There are two walk-through Jupyter Notebooks, Appendix A and Appendix B, which cover the numerical opimization and probabilistic programming methods, respectively
* There is a Report .pdf file which contains a considerable amount of literature review
* This work has also been published in the **[Research Notes of the AAS](https://iopscience.iop.org/journal/2515-5172)**, which can be referred to when looking for a concise presentation of the results

## Presented Work at 243rd Meeting of the American Astronomical Society, (January, 2024)
