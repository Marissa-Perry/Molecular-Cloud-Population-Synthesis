* Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) summer project with Dr. Jens Kauffmann at MIT Haystack Observatory
* Theoretically modeled the decomposition of an extragalactic molecular line luminosity signal into its cloud population molecular line luminosity components
* This was first done with numerical optimization using SciPy Optimize Minimize (refer to Appendix A), then with probabilistic programming using PyMC3 (refer to Appendix B)

## Presented Work at 243rd Meeting of the American Astronomical Society, (January, 2024)
